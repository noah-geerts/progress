## Notes

1. All endpoints require authentication except those under `/public/*`
2. Unauthorized requests will receive a 401 response
3. All requests with fields that do not match the backend Dto will receive 400 Bad Request when Jakarta validation catches the incorrect field(s)
4. Date parameters should be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
5. The `uid` field is automatically populated from the authenticated user's JWT token
6. When creating sessions, the `date` is automatically set to the current date
7. Deleting a session will cascade delete all associated performed exercises and sets
8. Deleting a performed exercise will cascade delete all associated sets
9. The `position` field determines the sequence of performed exercises within a session and sets within a performed exercise
